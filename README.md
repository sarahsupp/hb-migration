hb-migration
============

This repository is to collect the code for projects to describe and predict the migration of North American hummingbird species for 2004-2013 and into the future. Species include: anna's, allen's, black-chinned, broad-billed, broad-tailed, calliope, costa's, rufous, and ruby-throated hummingbird. Contains code for cleaning eBird data, describing and analyzing species migration paths and timing, exploring environmental and climate correlations with migration, hummingbird physiology, and predicting response to climate change. Generates all results and figures for the paper(s) related to the project. We are working with movebank to automate data annotation with movebank for "non-track" data points. Collaborators on this and related projects include S. R. Supp, F. A. La Sorte, T.A. Cormier, M. C.W. Lim, G. Bohrer, D. Powers, S. Wethington, S. Goetz, P.A. Beck, and C. H. Graham.
Code was written by SRS, TC, and modified from FAL and PAB.

The code and data in this repository allow for the analyses and figures to be fully replicated using eBird data, BBL data,  GBIF data, icosahedron map of North America, and remote sensing products.

The project and code in this repository are still under development.

**Requirements:**
R 3.x, R packages `chron`, `fields`, `knitr`, `gamm4` , `geosphere`, `ggplot2`, `ggmap`, `lme4`, `ltm`, `maps`, `maptools`, `mapdata`, `mgcv`, `party`, `plyr`, `randomForest`, `Rarity`, `raster`, `reshape2`, `rgdal`, `Rmisc`, `RPostgreSQL`, `SDMTools`,  `sirad`, `sm`, `sp`, `spaa`, `timeDate`, `XML`, Python 2.7 or greater, Python modules `argparse`, `os`, `xml.etree.ElementTRee`, `xml.dom`, and files containing functions specific to this code.

The analyses can be replicated by changing the working directory at the top of the file .R to the location on your computer where you have stored the .R, .txt, and .csv files, and by modifying the pathnames for output to where you would like to store the results. Questions about the code should be directed to SRS (sarah@weecology.org).


**Data use:**
Data is currently privately housed, but may be requested for the purposes of replication. If you wish to use the data for additional research, you should contact the Graham lab (catherine.graham@stonybrook.edu) and Cornell Lab of Ornithology to request eBird data (http://ebird.org/ebird/data/download), or the corresponding author (sarah@weecology.org).
