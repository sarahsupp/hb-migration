hb-migration
============

This repository is to collect the code for a project to describe and predict the migration of North American hummingbird species for 2004-2013 and into the future. Species include: anna's, allen's, black-chinned, broad-billed, broad-tailed, calliope, costa's, rufous, and ruby-throated hummingbird. Contains code for cleaning eBird data, describing and analyzing species migration paths and timing, exploring environmental and climate correlations with migration, hummingbird physiology, and predicting response to climate change. Generates all results and figures for the paper(s) related to the project. We are working with movebank to automate data annotation with movebank for "non-track" data points. Collaborators on this project include S. R. Supp, F. A. La Sorte, T. Cormier, M. Lim, G. Bohrer, D. Powers, S. Wethington, and C. H. Graham.
Code was written by SRS, TC, and FAL.

The code and data in this repository allow for the analyses and figures to be fully replicated using eBird data, icosahedron map of North America, and remote sensing products.

The project and code in this repository are still under development.

**Requirements:**
R 3.x, R packages `chron`, `fields`, `knitr`, `gamm4` , `geosphere`, `ggplot2`, `ggmap`, `maps`, `maptools`, `mapdata`, `mgcv`, `plyr`, `raster`, `reshape2`, `rgdal`, `Rmisc`, `RPostgreSQL`, `SDMTools`, `sp`, `spaa`, `XML`, Python 2.7 or greater, Python modules `argparse`, `os`, `xml.etree.ElementTRee`, `xml.dom`, and files containing functions specific to this code.

The analyses can be replicated by changing the working directory at the top of the file .R to the location on your computer where you have stored the .R, .txt, and .csv files, and by modifying the pathnames for output to where you would like to store the results. Questions about the code should be directed to SRS (sarah@weecology.org).


**Data use:**
Data is currently privately housed, but may be requested for the purposes of replication. If you wish to use the data for additional research, you should contact the Graham lab (catherine.graham@stonybrook.edu) and Cornell Lab of Ornithology to request eBird data (http://ebird.org/ebird/data/download), or the corresponding author (sarah@weecology.org).

*Datasets needed*
* eBird observation localities with species and date
* eBird list of complete checklists
* eBird effort data by hexagon cell
* icosahedron cell data
* mapdata
* environmental rasters and data from movebank, interpolated to daily values


**Included Files:**
* `hb-migration.r` script -- cleans up the trait and community datasets, runs descriptive analyses, and outputs figures.
* `migration-fxns.r` script -- stores functions for subsetting, analyzing, and plotting the data.
* `aggregate_hb_checkllists.r` script -- separates the original queried file into separate files for each species, writes to file
* `BBLmapcode.r` script -- maps foreign recaptures from Bird Banding Lab data. M. Lim
* `hb_movebank_createXML.py` script -- creates xml files for submission to movebank.org for annotation with environmental variables.
* `hb-submit_request_movebank.r` script -- submits annotation request to movebank using curl
* `hb-submit_movebank_request.sh` script -- generates and submits movebank annotation request using point locations and a request xml generated by `hb_movebank_createXML.py`. 
* `hb_movebank_downloadAnnotation_csv.sh` script -- checks status of movebank requests and downloads annotated files when they are available.
* `hb_prep_mb-ebd_tracks.R` script -- prepares the eBird data for annotation with movebank environmental data
* * `eBird-effort.r` script -- makes maps of total citizen science checklist effort per hex cell for each year, using the effort file downloaded from the eBird portal. Contains daily data. (not needed)
* `eBird-effort-new.r` script -- processes the eBird effort data (not needed)
* `hb-centroids.r` script -- current a "junk" script. Is not necessary to run analyses. (not needed)
* `present_figs.r` script -- generated figures for a presentation in May 2014 (not needed)
