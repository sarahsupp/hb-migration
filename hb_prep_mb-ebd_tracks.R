#This is for model building, as we are only looking at areas (grid cells) in which the hb
#was observed. Later, for temporal prediction, we'll have to use the whole envelope, within which
#hbs were observed and not observed.

#in fact, when I do this "for real" later (soon?), I will just request the whole area (need to figure out
#how to determine what the "whole area" is) for every day and extract from that the ebird observations.  That way,
#I get all of the data in one swoop and don't ask for the same thing multiple times from movebank. But before that 
#happens, I need to tile this probably.  Also, haven't settled on a resoltion..though this res (32km) is finer
#than the hex analysis. 250m might be an unweildy amount of data.
